# Potential Applications

1. A real-time notification system: Build a system that sends
   notifications in real-time to subscribed users whenever a
   certain event occurs. For example, you could build a news
   app that notifies users of breaking news as soon as it
   happens, or a social media platform that sends
   notifications to users when their posts receive comments
   or likes.

2. A weather app: Build a weather app that updates its
   display in real-time as weather conditions change. You
   could use the observer pattern to subscribe to weather
   data updates from a third-party API, and then update the
   app's display with the new data as it becomes available.

3. A stock trading app: Build an app that allows users to
   monitor the stock market in real-time and receive
   notifications when certain conditions are met. For
   example, you could use the observer pattern to subscribe
   to real-time stock price updates from a financial data
   provider, and then send notifications to users when the
   price of a certain stock reaches a certain threshold.
